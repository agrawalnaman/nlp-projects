    "\n",
    "For evaluation, we check the key to **group** all the sentences in the test data which have the same sense for the same target word. Then we run the function on all these sentences (of a *group*) to check whether most of them (ideally all of them) have the same index or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "On running the function on all these sentences (of a *group*) we get the sense indices. We are making an assumption here, that is, the most common sense index that we are obtaining is the correct sense index for this *group* of sentences. Then the measure of accuracy is calculated using the formula:\n",
